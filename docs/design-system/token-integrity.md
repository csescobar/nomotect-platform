# Design-token integrity

NomoTect treats token substitution as an architecture contract, not only as a
theme feature. Application surfaces must inherit presentation decisions from
`config/design_tokens/tokens.yml` through generated CSS custom properties.

## Public theme contract

The runtime supports two explicit themes: Light and Dark. Light is the default
when no valid stored choice exists. Operating-system preference does not create
a third public mode.

## Token layers

- Base tokens define typography, spacing, radius, shadow, control size and
  motion primitives shared by both themes.
- Theme tokens define semantic colors for Light and Dark.
- Fixed-canvas tokens describe deliberately dark illustrations, terminal
  previews and window controls. They are still tokens so an application can
  replace the complete visual language without editing component CSS.

## Enforcement

Run:

```bash
bin/rails design_tokens:check
ruby bin/design-token-audit
```

The first command proves that committed generated artifacts match the canonical
YAML. The second rejects hexadecimal, RGB and HSL color literals in all
non-generated stylesheets.

If a component needs a visual value that does not have a suitable token, extend
the semantic vocabulary in `tokens.yml`, generate the artifacts and document
the new role. Do not add a local literal or a fallback palette value.

## Certification substitution

Visual certification uses a temporary, deliberately different token set. It
must alter at least primary and semantic colors, typography, radius, spacing,
shadow and control height. The substituted build is evidence-only and does not
add a third selectable theme.

Review the following representative surfaces in both public themes:

- authenticated application shell;
- installation workflow;
- Component Showcase;
- public marketing pages;
- default Grid Engine composition.

Any element that retains the default presentation requires either a missing
semantic token or a documented fixed-canvas decision. Certification fails if
application-specific CSS is required to repair the substituted build.
